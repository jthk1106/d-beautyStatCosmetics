              <p>How do I withdraw my consent?</p>
              <p>If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you with future effect and without affecting the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Data based on the consent you provided before you withdrew it, at any time, by contacting us at email address <a href="mailto:customerservice@beautystatcosmetics.com" class="no-tracking">customerservice@beautystatcosmetics.com</a>, by following the opt-out instructions in the email or newsletter, or by sending mail to our Customer Service Team with address at 13507 Van Nuys Blvd #4703 Pacoima, CA. 91333-4703.

              <h4>SECTION 4 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h4>
              <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform certain services they provide to us. Certain third-party services, such as payment gateways and other transaction or payment processors are required to abide by security standards imposed on them, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), which is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all payment processors that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. All direct payment gateways we utilize adhere to PCI-DSS, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover, to safeguard card data handling.</p>
              <p>Whilst we shall not store your credit card information, such payment gateways and other transaction or payment processors, under PCI-DSS, may store your purchase transaction data for only as long as is necessary to complete the transaction and thereafter for only as long as it is required by law.</p>
              <p>Such third-party payment gateways and other payment transaction processors and other third parties have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>
              <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>
              <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>
              <p>Once you leave our Site or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>

              <p>We shall take prompt action to investigate the Security Breach and shall use industry standard, commercially reasonable, efforts to mitigate the effects of any such Security Breach in accordance with its obligations hereunder and, subject to your prior written agreement, to carry out any recovery or other action necessary to remedy the Security Breach.
